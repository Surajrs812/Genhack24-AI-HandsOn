# GenHack '24: "Empowering the Future with Generative AI: Concepts and Tools"

Hello Vit-ians! ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains the hands-on codes discussed during my talk at **GenHack '24** on _"Empowering the Future with Generative AI: Concepts and Tools"_. I hope the session gave you valuable insights into the future of AI, and I trust you are all excited to continue your journey in AI with confidence and enthusiasm.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Surajrs812/Genhack24-AI-HandsOn.git
   ```

2. **Install the necessary dependencies**:
   You will find a `requirements.txt` file in the root of the project. Install all dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up API Keys**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys for the following:
   - **Groq API Key**: For generative AI functionalities.
   - **Gemini API Key**: For embeddings and AI-powered tasks.
   - **Anthropic API Key**: For ChatAnthropic interactions.
   - **Weather API Key**: For fetching real-time weather data (Open weather)

   Your `.env` file should look like this:

   ```bash
   GROQ_API_KEY=<your-groq-api-key>
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-anthropic-api-key>
   WEATHER_API_KEY=<your-weather-api-key>
   ```

4. **Run the code**:
   Once everything is set up, you can run the scripts as demonstrated during the session:

   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```
   For Document RAG, run 

    ```bash
    streamlit run Document_rag
    ```

## Project Highlight: BrahmaSumm

In addition to the hands-on code, I am contributing to an open-source project called **BrahmaSumm**. It's an efficient summarization and search application that can revolutionize the way we process and retrieve information.

### Check it out:
- **Repository**: [BrahmaSumm GitHub](https://github.com/balajivis/BrahmaSumm)
- **Website**: [BrahmaSumm](https://brahmasumm.com)

### I encourage you to explore the project and consider starring the repository. Your support would mean a lot!

## Special Thanks

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to **VIT, Vellore** for giving me the opportunity to present at GenHack '24 and share my passion for Generative AI with all of you. 

## Need Help?

If you run into any issues with the code, have questions about projects, or need guidance on learning AI, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm more than happy to help and support you on your journey.

Let's continue pushing the boundaries of AI together! ðŸš€

Best Regards,
